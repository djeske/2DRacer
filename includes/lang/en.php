										Worse rated players in contrast are rewarded more for <strong>surprisingly good race positions</strong>. As a result players are held together around the default 1000 points mark as by an elastic band.
										The 2DRacer who combines patience, ambition and determination along with the ability to get over some throwbacks has a great chance to make it to the glorious top of 2DRacer's world rankings.",
